# Customer-Churn
Customer Churn occurs when subscribers or customers stop doing business with a company or service. A business typically treats a customer as churned once a specific amount of time has passed since the customers last interaction with the business or service.
Retaining customers is obviously important for companies, because it boosts that companies revenue and helps the company to build a meaningful relationship with the customer. What might not be so obvious is that customer retention is actually more valuable than customer acquisition and there is a lot of data to back this claim.

I have used Logistic Regression to train a model. Please check the customer_churn.ipynb for code.
